# What I did to recover my files

1. Download DMDE

2. Open and select physical drive

3. Click `Full Scan` but don't click `Scan` yet

4. Only have `Raw` selected

5. Open `Raw: File Signatures`

6. Download + `Load` my [MCA and DAT-log rawsign.ini](MCA%20and%20DAT-log%20rawsign.ini)

8. Click `Ok` then `Scan` to start scanning

9. Wait for it to be done.... or don't it allows you to continue if you stop it

10. Select files to recover (be aware that some may be big, I would recommend only recovering files less than a gigabyte)

1GB = 1 000 000 000 bytes in the software
